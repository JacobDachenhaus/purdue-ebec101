Description:
    Describe your program here.

Contributors:
    None

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [x] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [x] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [x] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.

Academic Integrity Statement:
    I have not used source code obtained from any unauthorized
    source, either modified or unmodified; nor have I provided
    another student access to my code.  The project I am
    submitting is my own original work.
